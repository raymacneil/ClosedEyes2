# Closed Eyes 2.0

This is the repository for the code and configuration files of the Closed Eyes 2.0 project, a collaboration between the [UBC Vision Lab](https://visionlab.psych.ubc.ca/) and MEMs lab (UBC Mechanical Engineering).  

The experiment code is written in Python and depends critically on the [PscyhoPy framework](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy) and [Lab Streaming Layer](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/pylsl). 

Significant adaptations were made to the ogiginal code (from Closed Eyes 1.0) to allow a more streamlined and flexible means of running the different task conditions and controlling task paramaters. The inclusion of 'configuration files' are the engine of this improved flexibility.
